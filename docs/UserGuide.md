if you already have an existing product and just want to <i>increase</i> the quantity when you have new stocks. 
</div>

### Example 1
Context: 
- Product `Pen`'s Product ID (PID) is 1.
- Current `QUANTITY` of `Pen` is 40.
- Now, you have 20 new incoming stocks for `Pen` and you wish to update the quantity.

Input:
```
inflow 1 a/20
```

Output:
```
Quantity updated. Quantity: 60
```

### Example 2
Context:
- Product `Curve Ruler`'s Product ID (PID) is 2.
- Current `QUANTITY` of `Curve Ruler` is 35.
- Now, you have 10 new incoming stocks for `Curve Ruler` and you wish to update the quantity.

  Input:
```
inflow 2 a/10
```

Output:
```
Quantity updated. Quantity: 45

if you already have an existing product and just want to <i>decrease</i> the quantity when you sell your stocks. 
</div>

### Example 1
Context:
- Product `Curve Ruler`'s Product ID (PID) is 2.
- Current `QUANTITY` of `Curve Ruler` is 45.
- Now, you sold 30 `Curve Ruler` and you wish to update the quantity.

Input:
```
outflow 2 a/30
```

Output:
```
Warning! This product is low in quality.
Quantity updated. Quantity: 15
```

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b; background-color: #fcf8e3;">
:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong> Note that the warning will only appear once when the quantity first falls
below quantity of 20. All low quantity products will be displayed when you exit the program.
</div>

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b; background-color: #fcf8e3;">
:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong> Do note that if you added a new product with a quantity lower than the threshold
quantity, warning will also be raised. 
</div>

### Example 2
Context:
- Product `Pen`'s Product ID (PID) is 1.
- Current `QUANTITY` of `Pen` is 60.
- Now, you sold 35 `Pen` and you wish to update the quantity.

Input:
```
outflow 1 a/35
```

Output:
```
Quantity updated. Quantity: 25
```

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b; background-color: #fcf8e3;">
:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong> Since the new quantity does not fall below 20, no warning is given. 
</div>

Explanation:
The `outflow` command will update the quantity of the product by performing subtraction
of the outflow quantity from the current quantity.

## Viewing Past Inflow / Outflow of Existing Product: `history`

### When to Use?
When you want to check on the previous inflow or outflow of a product, use this command!


Format:
```
history PID
```

| Parameter  | Representation                      | Constraints                                        |
|------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `PID`      | Product ID of the existing product. | Must be a valid Product ID of an existing product. |


### Example 1
Input:
```
history 1
```

Output:
```
1. PID: 1  |  Change in quantity: 20  |  Date of inflow: 29-03-2024 17:27:24
2. PID: 1  |  Change in quantity: -35  |  Date of outflow: 05-04-2024 17:33:40
```

**Explanation:** <br>
This command will find any inflow or outflow quantities of your product which has PID 1, which is your `Pen` product. <br>
As seen, you tried to: 
* Increase the quantity of `Pen` by 20 on 29th March 2024, at 17:27:24 hours
* Decrease the quantity of `Pen` by 35 on 5th April 2024, at 17:33:40 hours

### Example 2
Input:
```
history 2
```

Output:
```
1. PID: 2  |  Change in quantity: 10  |  Date of inflow: 18-03-2024 08:00:31
2. PID: 2  |  Change in quantity: -30  |  Date of outflow: 01-04-2024 10:00:00
```

**Explanation:** <br>
This command will find any inflow or outflow quantities of your `Curve Ruler` which has PID 2. <br>
As seen, you tried to:
* Increase the quantity of `Curve Ruler` by 10 on 18th March 2024, at 08:00:31 hours 
* Decrease the quantity of `Curve Ruler` by 30 on 1st April 2024, at 10:00:00 hours

## Saving the Data

StockPal data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


## Editing the Data File

StockPal inventory data is saved automatically as a CSV file `[JAR file location]/data/inventory.csv`, while the past transactions data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/transactions.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing these data files, even though it is **highly not recommended**.

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7;">
:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> Allowed characters to use when editing the data file:<br>
<code>a-z</code>, <code>A-Z</code>, <code>0-9</code>, <code> </code>, <code>()</code>, <code>[]</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>_</code>
</div>

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede;">
:exclamation:<strong>Caution:</strong>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, StockPal will not discard the data, but instead display an error that the data has erroneous input, and close the app thereafter. <br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause StockPal to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). For example,<br>
<ul>
    <li>When editing the data file, you should <strong>NOT</strong> be editing the <code>PID</code> or the <code>name</code> of the products directly, as it will most likely cause errors in the application itself, and StockPal will show errors if there are duplicate <code>PID</code>s or <code>name</code>s.</li>
    <li>If you want to do an <a href="https://ay2324s2-cs2113t-t09-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#increasing-a-product-quantity-inflow"><code>inflow</code></a> or <a href="https://ay2324s2-cs2113t-t09-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#decreasing-a-product-quantity-outflow"><code>outflow</code></a>, do not do it by editing the data file itself, as these edits will not be recorded in the transactions list of StockPal.</li>
    <li>Do <strong>be careful</strong> when using the semicolon character (<code>;</code>) when editing <code>inventory.csv</code>, as that is the main separator of the CSV file, adding or removing them will likely cause data to be lost.</li>
</ul>
Therefore, edit the data file <strong>only if</strong> you are confident that you can update it correctly, as we would <strong>not</strong> be responsible for any errors caused by the manual editing of the data file, and it is <strong>recommended</strong> to make a backup of the file before editing it.
